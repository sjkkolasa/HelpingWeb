                <h3>About Our Organization</h3>
            </div>

            <p class="body-text my-5">Helping Web is a volunteer-led project that creates simple, effective websites for organizations and individuals working toward a positive cause. We use our technical skills to help your good work have an online presence. Many meaningful causes lack the funds to hire a website designer or the technical know-how to make one themselves. Helping Web is made up of volunteers who have a background in computers and website design and want to volunteer their time to make efforts like yours even more successful. It's our way of saying thank you for doing what you do.</p>

            <h4 class="subheader">What We Do</h4>

            <p class="body-text my-5">Helping Web partners with people and organizations who are doing work that benefits others. We focus on building websites that are:</p>
            <ul class="body-text mx-5 my-5 dotted">
                <li>Clear and easy to navigate</li>
                <li>Affordable or free for qualifying causes</li>
                <li>Simple to maintain and update over time</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4 class="subheader">Who We Help</h4>

            <p class="body-text my-5">We prioritize projects that serve communities, education, service initiatives, and other positive causes. This may include nonprofits, local programs, grassroots efforts, and individuals working to make a difference. We do not accept any payment for our service.</p>
            <p class="body-text my-5">If you need a website for a for-profit small business, you should still get in touch. We may ask you to make a donation directly to a charity in lieu of a payment to us.</p>
        
            <h4 class="subheader">Why We Started</h4>

            <p class="body-text my-5">Helping Web began as a way for our family to work together on something meaningful. The “kids” in our family gained technical skills in college that they want to leverage to help others. Sarah earned a degree in computer science and Josh is starting his senior year with a major in computer engineering. Heather (mom) enjoys graphic design and networking. Helping Web is a natural outgrowth from our specific combination of skills and values.</p>
